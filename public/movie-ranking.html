<h1>My personal Top 5 Movies (Anime And Not)</h1>
<h2>Quick List of my Top 5 Movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Koe No Katachi</h3>
<p>Beautiful images, accurate representation of childhood as well as important bonds between people and 
    the strength required to forgive and move on with life</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Along with Oppenheimer it has to be one of the most accurate movies that describe outerspace with a touch of romanticism and fantasy;
this entire mix makes for a perfect movie for the second spot.</p>

<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>With its catchy songs and beautiful clay modeled stop animation it easily takes a spot in my heart with also the important lesson
    it gives to kids which is to always be yourself because there will always be someone to love you for who you are.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>Another musical in the list with amazing songs, deep meaning in everyone of them embracing diversity and also teaching another important
lesson which is never give up on your dreams, believe in yourself and give life everything you've got</p>

<h3>Steins;Gate The movie</h3>
<p>Following the adventures of Rintaro Okabe through every timeline we finally get to the steins;gate but there's a problem:
    his memories from every timeline is overwriting his existance in this perfect timeline where everybody lives and i think its a
    perfect twist to the ending of Steins;Gate and adds a little spice with some nice romance between Rintaro and Kurisu.</p>
